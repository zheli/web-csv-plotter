web-csv-plotter
===============

A simple tool I made at work, plot data from local csv file onto an interactive HTML5 chart.

Introduction
===============
It is still very simple, but it works for me. I don't have to manually plot csv data into Excel anymore.

Prerequisites
===============
* Python
* Django

How to run it
===============
All the CSV files should be in C:\. Launch server using:

    python manage.py runserver

and visit localhost:8000 in your browser
